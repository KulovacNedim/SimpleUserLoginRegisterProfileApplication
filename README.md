Simple one-afternoon project in BILD-IT coworking space. 

Task: 
Make Java web application with next features:

●	Deleting logged user account <br>
●	Logout


Technologies you need to use:
● Bootstrap or HTML / CSS<br>
● MySQL<br>
● JDBC<br>

BONUS 1:
If it's still a banal task - add user roles to your system :
- admin (has option to list all registered users in the system, delete users, or edit user data)
- user. 

BONUS 2:
Validate data fields. Nothing fancy, but at least some basic server side validation.
